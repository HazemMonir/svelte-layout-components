## Welcome

This repo is based on [svelte/template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

I created some layouts from [EveryLayout](https://every-layout.dev/), they are great!
Also I like [ColorSupply](https://colorsupplyyy.com/app) very much.

Feel free to explore these layout components! Feedback and bug reports welcome. :)

You can see it [here](https://silvancodes.github.io/svelte-layout-components/) on github pages.

## Get started

*You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

Degit repo and install the dependencies to start your own project.

```bash
npx degit SilvanCodes/svelte-layout-components svelte-layouts
cd svelte-layouts
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
