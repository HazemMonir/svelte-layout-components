## Welcome

This repo is based on [svelte/template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).

I created some layouts from [EveryLayout](https://every-layout.dev/), they are great!
Also I like to try and play with [ColorSupply](https://colorsupplyyy.com/app).

Feel free to play around with these layout components! Feedback and bug reports welcome. :)

Also this is very much WIP. You can see it [here](https://silvancodes.github.io/svelte-layout-components/) on github pages .

## Get started

Clone repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SilvanCodes/svelte-layout-components.git
cd svelte-layout-components
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
